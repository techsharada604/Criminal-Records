# Criminal Records Database

## Introduction
A criminal records database is a centralised repository of information related to individuals who have been
involved in criminal activities or have interacted with the criminal justice system. Government organisations like
police departments, courts, or specialist criminal records bureaus that are in charge of law enforcement, criminal
justice, or public safety often maintain criminal records databases. In order to perform background checks,
confirm peopleâ€™s criminal records, and make educated judgments about employing, housing, or other contacts,
law enforcement agencies, courts, employers, landlords, and other authorised bodies can all benefit greatly from
the database.
